Apart from above \u2018in principle\u2019 approval for creation of eight new Tiger Reserves has been accorded. The selection of reserves was guided by the need to conserve unique ecosystem/habitat types across the geographic distribution of tigers in the country.\n\nProject Tiger is an ongoing Centrally Sponsored Scheme, which is continued, in the XIth five-year Plan. Conservation of endangered species and their habitat, strengthening and enhancing the Protected Area Network, control of poaching, monitoring, research and ensuring people\u2019s participation in Wildlife Conservation have been accorded high priority in the National Wildlife Action Plan and the Wildlife Conservation strategy, 2002.",
